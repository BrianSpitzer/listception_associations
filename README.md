# Listception Associations

## Associations practice

In this project, you will build a simple clone of [Trello](https://trello.com/).

### [Here is your target.](https://listception-associations.herokuapp.com/)

## Setup

 1. Set up [a Cloud9 workspace as usual](https://guides.firstdraft.com/getting-started-with-cloud-9.html).
 1. `bin/setup`
 1. Run project
 1. I've already generated starter resources for you, and you'll find some dummy data already exists.
 1. Your job is to add association helper methods between boards, lists, cards, and tags as needed; then make your app match the target.
 1. The key page to work on improving is `boards#show`. Here I can see a board's lists, the cards on each list, add a new list, and add a card to each list.
 1. Good luck!
